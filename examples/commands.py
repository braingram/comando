# Comando command protocol example
# 2016/03/23 : Brett Graham
#
# This is a simple example that shows how to control the arduino led
# from python
#
# This example shows how to:
# - receive text messages from the arduino
# - send commands from python to the arduino
# - receive commands from the arduino in python
#
# see libraries/comando/examples/commands in the comando repository for the
# corresponding arduino code

# ctypes is useful for defining fixed size data types

if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    raise Exception("A serial port must be supplied: commands.py <port>")
port = sys.argv[1]

# open the serial port
serial_port = serial.Serial(port, 9600)

# create comando, the stream handler
com = pycomando.Comando(serial_port)
# create a few protocols to receive text and send/receive commands
text = pycomando.protocols.TextProtocol(com)
cmd = pycomando.protocols.CommandProtocol(com)

# register the created protocols, the protocol ids (first argument)
# should match on both the arduino and in python

# define a callback to be used for the text protocol
def print_message(msg):
    # just print out the message with a header
    print("from arduino->%s" % msg)


# define a callback that will be called when the arduino sends
# a specific command to python
def led_set(cmd):
    # first, check if the command contained any arguments
    if not cmd.has_arg():
        # if not, throw an error
        raise Exception("Invalid led_set response, missing arg")
    # read the argument, you must tell comando the data type so
    # it knows how many bytes to unpack, this is where it is
    # helpful to use ctypes data types rather than the usual
    # python types as they are of a fixed size

# sends a command of "0" to python
cmd.register_callback(0, led_set)

# send an initial command to the arduino to turn off the led
cmd.send_command(0, (ctypes.c_byte(0), ))

# this code below reads input from the user and sets the led value
# to that input and updates comando to handle any incoming messages
# from the arduino

            # send the input to the arduino, notice the command id
            # and that the second argument is a tuple (or could be any iterator
            cmd.send_command(0, (ctypes.c_byte(i), ))
        except Exception as e:
            print("Invalid input: %s" % e)
        # update comando
        while serial_port.inWaiting():
            com.handle_stream()

    # finally, close the serial port and exit
